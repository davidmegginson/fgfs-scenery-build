FlightGear scenery for Canada and the US (CONUS)
================================================

The scenery is optimised for low-level visual navigation, and contains much more detail (roads, rivers, streams, coastlines, railroads, lakes, etc) than is available in the default "TerraSync" FlightGear scenery as of early 2023, as well as more-varied (and up-to-date) landcover. The scenery will work with both the stable "release/2020.3" branch and the "next" branch of FlightGear.

By default, you will not have scenery models and other buildings/roads/etc in this scenery, but see below for an easy hack to include them.

## Scenery models and osm2city

I have not yet added scenery models and osm2city to this scenery. However, I have included a script that will allow you to cheat. If you want to include buildings (etc) added via TerraSync, _and_ you are using a Unix-like operating system (including Linux or MacOS), you can use the follow script to set up symbolic links to the data that TerraSync downloads:

  $ sh gen-symlinks.sh
  
To remove the links, run

  $ sh clean-symlinks.sh
  
Because the elevations are not exactly identical with the default scenery, there will be occasional issues: buildings may occasionally appear partly submerged, and road segments will occasionally disappear underground, but for the most part, it works well as a short-term hack. I will learn how to include those features properly in the future.

(There is also a file ``gen-symlinks.bat``, but I haven't tested it.)

## Sources

The scenery uses the following open sources:

* Elevations from the SRTM-3 DEM (Digital Elevation Model)
* Coarse landcover from the joint Canada/US 250m MODIS-250 landcover raster
* Airport layouts from the X-Plane Scenery Gateway
* Detailed landcover, inland water, roads, railways, and powerline areas from OpenStreetMap

For more details, see https://github.com/davidmegginson/fgfs-scenery-build , which contains the build scripts.
