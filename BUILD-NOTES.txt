Vegetation:
- crashing (e.g. for TXKF) in osg::Image::getColor called by SGTriangleInfo:addRandomTreePoints adding trees using texture ${FG_ROOT}/Textures/Trees/tropical-alt.png


Elevations:
- gdalchop must do all FABDEM geotiffs in a single command
- solution is to build overlapping areas in a temp directory, then
  move target bucket into working directory

OSM:

- leisure=nature-reserve may be a marine area (like the Galapagos), so
  don't use for scenery building

w080n40:

- after building bucket, rebuild w74n40 (Manhattan) with SRTM-3,
  because FABDEM fails to filter out the skyscrapers

- note also some missing textures in Queens west of KLGA
