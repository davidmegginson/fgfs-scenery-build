Elevation gullies:
- gdalchop must do all FABDEM geotiffs in a single command
- solution is to build overlapping areas in a temp directory, then move target bucket into working directory

w080n40:
- after building bucket, rebuild w74n40 (Manhattan) with SRTM-3, because FABDEM fails to filter out the skyscrapers
- note also some missing textures in Queens west of KLGA
