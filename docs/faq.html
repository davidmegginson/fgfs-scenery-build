          How do I get FlightGear to use the scenery?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          If you are starting from the commandline, add the option
          <code>--fg-scenery=PATH/fgfs-canada-us-scenery/</code>,
          replacing <var>PATH</var> with the actual path to the
          location where you installed the scenery (you can put the
          option in your <code>$HOME/.fgfsrc</code> file to use it
          every time). If you are using the launcher, select the
          <i>Add-ons</i> tab and put the path (without the
          <code>--fg-scenery=</code> prefix) in the <i>Additional
          scenery folders</i> section.

        <dt>
          Why don't I see airport buildings, osm2city details, etc?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          In Unix-like operating systems (Linux, MacOS), you need to
          run the script gen-symlinks.sh to create symbolic links to
          your TerraSync scenery. You also need to have TerraSync
          enabled. In Windows, or if you have your <code>.fgfs/</code>
          directory in a non-standard location, you will need to
          create the links manually. There is no script yet for Windows 
          (I don't use it), but apparently the <cmd>mklink</cmd> command
          will create symlinks. If any Windows user cares to contribute
          a <code>.bat</code> file, I will add it to this repo.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Why do roads and railroads stop at rivers?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Originally, the scenery carried roads and railroads across
          rivers so that the crossings would be visible for users who
          haven't enabled osm2city, but that creates strange artifacts
          for people using more-detailed scenery, so I am gradually
          rebuilding the scenery to exclude any OSM road/railroad
          segments with <code>bridge=yes</code>. Some may still
          appear, when the OSM source is not correctly tagged.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          What are the long, wide grassy areas?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Those are rights of way for high-voltage powerlines. In real
          life flying, unless you are very low, you usually won't see
          the towers or lines, but you will see the cleared areas. If
          you enable osm2city, the lines and towers will usually be
          added.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          What data sources did you use?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Elevations: 1-arcsec (30m) Copernicus GLO DEM (<a href="https://data.bris.ac.uk/data/dataset/s5hqmjcdj8yo2ibzi9b4ew3sn">FABDEM</a>)<br/>
          Landcover: <a href="http://www.cec.org/north-american-environmental-atlas/land-cover-2010-modis-250m/">MODIS-250</a> 250m raster (2010)<br/>
          Airport data: <a href="https://gateway.x-plane.com/">X-Plane Scenery Gateway</a><br/>
          Landmass, detailed landuse, rivers, roads, railways, and powerline rights-of-way: <a href="https://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Why not use a 10m landcover raster?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          I'm using MODIS-250 mainly for background, with OpenStreetMap data filling in the details. Because I'm
          converting to vector data, a 10m landcover raster,
          processing exceeded my resources for such large areas, and the resulting scenery would probably have
          had too many triangles for most users. To see a more-detailed raster (but less detailed rivers and other
          water features), try the new WS3.0 scenery under development.

          Who are you?

          I am <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Megginson">David
          Megginson</a>, a former real-life aircraft owner and early
          contributor to FlightGear. Starting in the late 1990s, among
          other features, I created the FlightGear Property system,
          added support for multi-engine and tailwheel, aircraft, and
          added the first TerraGear support for line features like
          roads and railroads. I also created the earliest models of
          the Piper PA-28-161, Piper Cub, DC-3, Cessna 172, and Cessna
          310 (all of which have since been improved or replaced by
          more-talented aircraft designers). The main goal of my early
          contributions was to make it possible for people to
          contribute without writing C++ code, and I'm happy to see a
          thriving community today. I also maintain the open-data <a
