      <p>
        This free (<i>libre</i> and <i>gratuit</i>) scenery includes
        thousands of airports and millions of square kilometers of
        terrain, so it is impossible to check more than a tiny sample
        before release. Your bug reports are critical for finding
        problems to prioritise fixing in future releases.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you find a scenery bug, or would like to request a missing
        airport or other feature, please go to GitHub and create an
        issue at
      </p>

        You will need a free GitHub account, which will be useful for
        reporting bugs on many other software projects as well. In
        your report, please include the following information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The location (either an airport code or lat/lon).
        </li>
        <li>
          A detailed description of the problem.
        </li>
        <li>
          A screenshot, if possible (use F3 to take a screenshot inside FlightGear).
        </li>
        <li>
          The release date of the scenery that you're using (it's in
          the scenery filename that you downloaded).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Thank you in advance for your contribution to open content and
        open-source! We need testers as much as we need designers,
        coders, and documentation writers.
