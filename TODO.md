North American Scenery TODO
===========================

## Short term
- add 250m landcover data for remainder of North America (Greenland, Caribbean, Central America, Bermuda)
- use OSM forest and farmland attributes to improve coverage and diversity
- automatically switch between FABDEM and SRTM-3 elevation data as needed
- reduce reliance on shell scripts called by Makefile
- debug, debug, debug

## Longer term
- shift to 1 arcsec landcover (where available)
- build osm2city coverage custom for this scenery
- figure out how to import models
- add bridges and other prominent structures, especially around the Great Lakes, St Lawrence, and NYC
- add dynamic models of lake freighters and other large vessels
